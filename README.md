## Deploy Virtual Network

When creating a VNet, it is recommended that you use the address ranges enumerated in [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918), which have been set aside by the IETF for private, non-routable address spaces:

```10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255```
```172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255```
```192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255```
